Analysis of Mitski's most popular songs based off of lyrics, BPM, and number of streams.

This project analyzes the 3 most streamed songs from each of Mitski's 7 albums, resulting in 21 songs total. By using text analysis tools to find the most common words in each of these songs compared to the best performing BPM, it could be possible to create a song that appeals to a larger audience. While this analysis may not be useful for artists with larger platforms and a dedicated fanbase already, for smaller artists it could help promote their music and then later on allow them to branch out into different styles.
